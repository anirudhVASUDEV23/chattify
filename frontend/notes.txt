Exactly — this behavior is entirely because React is a SPA (Single Page Application).

Let's go step by step and connect the dots.

1. What SPA Means

In a Single Page Application (SPA):

Your React app loads once in the browser (initial HTML + JS bundle).

After that, React Router handles navigation on the client side.

Instead of the browser making a new request and reloading the entire page, React just swaps components dynamically inside the already loaded page.

Key idea: The browser never reloads the full page unless you explicitly refresh (F5).
Instead, React updates the DOM in-place.

2. How This Affects useEffect

Your code:

useEffect(() => {
  checkAuth();
}, [checkAuth]);


Here’s what happens:

Action	Does <App /> Unmount & Remount?	Does useEffect Run?
Hard Reload (F5)	✅ Yes	✅ Runs again
Client-Side Navigation (<Link>)	❌ No	❌ Does NOT run

Because in a SPA, client-side navigation doesn’t reload the entire application — only a part of the component tree changes.

So <App /> stays mounted in memory, and React just replaces the child <Route> component (ChatPage, LoginPage, etc.).

3. Visual Flow Example

Your component tree:

<App>
  └── <Routes>
        ├── "/"        → <ChatPage>
        ├── "/login"   → <LoginPage>
        └── "/signup"  → <SignUpPage>

Initial Load (Fresh tab)

Browser loads /login.

React mounts <App />.

useEffect in <App /> runs → checkAuth() fires.

Navigate to /signup using <Link>

React does NOT reload the page.

<App /> stays mounted.

<LoginPage /> unmounts, <SignUpPage /> mounts.

Since <App /> never unmounted, its useEffect does not re-run.

Browser Refresh at /signup

Browser discards everything and reloads the React app from scratch.

<App /> mounts fresh again.

useEffect runs again → checkAuth() fires again.

4. Why This is Good for Performance

In a non-SPA (multi-page app):

Every page navigation would hit the server → full reload.

checkAuth() would run on every single page change, even when not needed.

With React SPA:

The app only loads once.

checkAuth() runs only once on initial load, unless you explicitly call it again.

Navigation between pages is instant and handled in memory → faster UX.

5. Browser vs SPA Network Behavior
Action	Browser (Multi-page)	React SPA
Navigate to /login → /signup	Browser requests /signup from server → full reload	React swaps <LoginPage /> with <SignUpPage /> → no full reload
Initial Auth Check	Runs on every page load	Runs once unless manually re-called
Performance	Slower (network round-trip each time)	Faster (JS already loaded, just state changes)
6. When checkAuth Runs

Here’s the final summary:

Event	checkAuth() Runs?	Why
Initial page load (cold start)	✅ Yes	<App /> mounts for the first time
Browser refresh (F5)	✅ Yes	Entire React app remounts
Client-side navigation (<Link> or Navigate)	❌ No	<App /> stays mounted, SPA just swaps routes
After login/logout action	✅ If manually called	You need to trigger it yourself
7. Takeaway

This happens because React is a SPA, meaning there is only one initial load, and navigation happens inside the browser without a reload.

<App /> lives for the entire lifetime of the session unless the user refreshes or closes the tab.

checkAuth only runs automatically when <App /> mounts — i.e., initial load or hard reload.

This makes authentication checks faster and more efficient, as you avoid hitting the backend on every navigation.
